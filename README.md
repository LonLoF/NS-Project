 - preprocessing_visualization.ipynb file contains all the code to load and preprocess the data and get the visuals, it contains graph data feature analysis, which can take around 2 hours, it can be skipped if the data is imported from the data folder (graph_data.csv contains small subset of the data; graph_data_full.csv)
 - RandomForest.ipynb needs to access already preprocessed data, which can be imported from the data folder
